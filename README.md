# Board-Games-API

## `Summary`

This is `REST API` implementing `CRUD` operations for `Board Games` to feed a Board Games Club Website.

I used `ASP.NET Core`, `SQL Server` and `Entity Framework`.

I used `Database-First Approach` to create database and models to represent the database schema in C#.

The dataset is from Kaggle, an online community of data scientists that hosts several publicly accessible data sets for education and training purposes.
