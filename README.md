# Board-Games-API

## `Summary`

This is REST API for Board Games.

I used `ASP.NET Core 6`, `SQL Server` and `Entity Framework`.

I used `Database-First Approach` to create database and models to represent the database schema in C#.

The dataset is from Kaggle, an online community of data scientists that hosts several publicly accessible data sets for education and training purposes.
