# Board-Games-API

This is REST API for Board Games.

I used `ASP.NET Core 6`, `SQL Server` and `Entity Framework`.

I used `Database-First Approach` to create database and models to deal with this database.

The dataset is from Kaggle, an online community of data scientists that hosts several publicly accessible data sets for education and training purposes.
